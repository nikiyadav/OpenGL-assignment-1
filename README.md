This repo implements the following basic GLSL/shaders and transformations. Geometry of the objects/shapes is stored as a mesh in formats such as OFF/obj. 

Task 1:  Load and display a mesh, available as an OFF/obj file. Determine and apply appropriate model
transformations and orthographic projection to the mesh such that it appears in the middle of the
screen.

Task 2:  Allow rotation of the mesh about a fixed axis. Rotate the mesh continuously at an appropriate rate.

Task 3: Color the vertices in the mesh based on their current depth (distance from the camera) using shaders.

Task 4: Consider the mesh to be elastic, deform it and make it rebound to its original shape.
